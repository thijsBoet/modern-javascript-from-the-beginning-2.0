### OOP

#### Four parts of OOP

1. Abstraction: This is the process of hiding the complexity of a system and presenting only the essential details of the system to the user. This allows the user to interact with the system without needing to understand how it works.

2. Encapsulation: This refers to the bundling of data and functions into a single unit called an object. Objects are used to represent real world entities and enable data and functionality to be associated with each other.

3. Inheritance: This is the ability to create new classes based on existing ones. This allows the programmer to reuse code and reduces the amount of code that needs to be written.

4. Polymorphism: This is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. This allows the same code to be used to work with different types of objects, thus reducing the amount of code that needs to be written.
